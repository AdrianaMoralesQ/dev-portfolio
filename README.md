My website and portfolio. You can contact me directly via this website, check out my projects and get an overview of my skills. 

## Description
This single page app was created to show off my portfolio and skills, access my professional social media and so visitors they can easily get in touch via the contact form linked to my email.  

Each project has a short description of the stack used and why I created the specific project and why I used certain technologies. 

## Objective üèîÔ∏è
Building my developer portfolio for others to see.

## Stack üíª
* Netlify
Hosted on Netlify, this made deploying the website easy and fast
* Javascript
When I built my portfolio, I was most familiar with JS, so this was a no-brainer at the time
* Toastify
Library used for notifications - super easy to use and to customize
* Email.js
This library is user friendly and super easy to set-up, I used it to build my contact form
* Styled Components
I wanted to build and design every element of my page, so I used to styled components because it's so customaizable

## Executing program 

* Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
